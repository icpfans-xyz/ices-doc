# I. Background

* **Background**: Since there is a big difference between IC and EVM blockchain, and there is no event logging system, the event logging function needs to be implemented by the project party itself, ICES is an event logging system developed to solve a problem. 

* **Target group**: All IC's ecological project parties and IC users 
* **Technical application scenario**: Need to listen to canister events, collect canister information, and perform specific analysis of canister usage 
* **The overall idea**: load [ICES Motoko SDK](https://doc.ices.one/guide/tutorial-motoko) or [Rust SDK](https://doc.ices.one/guide/tutorial-rust) in the project, call ICES to provide a response to collect event information where the business needs to record event information, and finally ICES will collect these event logs processed and displayed in [ICES Explorer](https://explorer.ices.one/) 

#II. Operation steps

##2.1 Preparation 
* [DFX CLI](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/quickstart/local-quickstart.html) needs to be installed locally 
* Learn how to install and use the [ICES SDK](https://github.com/icpfans-xyz/ices-motoko-library). [learn more](https://doc.ices.one/)
 
##2.2 Using ICES Explorer 
* Access [ICES Explorer](https://explorer.ices.one/) 
* View log information
